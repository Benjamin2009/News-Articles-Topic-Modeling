## News Articles Topic Modeling

### Introduction

Topic modeling is to identify patterns in a text corpus that correspond to document topics. The goal of this project is to build models that can accurately mine hidden topics from previously unseen news articles. We will build both supervised and unsupervised models and then compare their performance.

### Dataset

The dataset is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/data). It includes 2225 BBC news articles, each labeled under one of 5 categories: business, entertainment, politics, sport or tech. 

### Python Libraries

Data wrangling and exploration:
- Pandas
- Numpy

Data Visualization:
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Text Preprocessing:
- NLTK

Modeling:
- Sklearn
  - NMF
  - RandomForestClassifier
  - LogisticRegression
